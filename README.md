# Built using Cursor Pro

### The process
1. Work with ChatGPT to generate a requirements document.
2. Scaffolded a React application with Vite + SCSS.
3. Added folder structures like models, components, services per my liking.
4. Created a requirements.md file and added to project.
5. Begin cursor prompting.  

### My experience
1.  The first past pretty much generated a 90% MVP.
2.  Then I just selectively prompt each area to fix and update features.
3.  Total time taken was about 2-3 hours from requirements to deployment.
4.  According to Cursor, I used about $0.80 of tokens.
